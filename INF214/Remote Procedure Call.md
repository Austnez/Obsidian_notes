What is remote procedure call in concurrent programming?
- Is used to allow a program running on one computer to execute code on a remote computer over a network.
- It enables communication between two processes or threads running on different machines by allowing them to call procedures or functions located on the remote machine as if they were local.
- How it works:
    1. The client makes a local procedure call as if it were calling a procedure in its own address space
    2. The Client’s runtime system sends the request over the network to the server. 
    3. The server’s application program processes the request and sends a response back to the client.
    4. The servers application program processes the request and sends a response back to the client.
    5. The client runtime system receives the response and passes it back to the client
- RPC mechanism abstracts the network communicating details
    - making it easy to build distributed systems
- Client/server interactions
- example:

```jsx
module MyModule
	headers of exported operations
body
	variable declarations
	initialization code
	procedures for exported operations
	local procedures and processes
end MyModule
```

- Module:
    - contains both processes and procedures.
    - resides in different address spaces, e.g, on different nodes in a network
    - processes can share variables within a module, and call procedures declared within that module
    - however: the process in one module can communicate with processes declared in another module only by calling procedures exported by the second module.
    - `headers`: exported modules, aka procedures exported from other modules
        - `op opname(formals) returns result`;
    - `body`: procedures that implement these operations, etc.
        - background processes (local)
    - RPC: an operation is implemented by a procedure.
        
        ```jsx
        procedure opname(formal identifiers) returns result identifier
        	declarations of local variables
        	statements
        end
        ```
        
    - `call moduleName.opname(arguments)`

### Time server example:
in a time server example, a client might want to retrieve the current time from a server. Here’s a simplified example of how RPC could be implemented in such a scenario:

**Server Side:**
```jsx
module TimeServer
    op getCurrentTime() returns string;
body
    procedure getCurrentTime() returns string
        return getCurrentTimeAsString(); // Assume this is a local method to get current time as string
    end
end TimeServer
```
In this example, the server has a module `TimeServer` which exports an operation `getCurrentTime` that returns the current time as a string.

**Client Side:**
```jsx
module TimeClient
body
    // Call the remote procedure to get the current time
    string time = call TimeServer.getCurrentTime();
    // Display the received time
    displayTime(time); // Assume this is a local method to display time
end TimeClient
```
In this example, the client has a module `TimeClient` which makes a call to the remote procedure `getCurrentTime` of the `TimeServer` module and then displays the received time.

#### Additional Information:

**Synchronization:**
- RPC can be either synchronous or asynchronous. In synchronous RPC, the client sends a request to the server and gets blocked while it waits for a response from the server. In asynchronous RPC, the client sends a request to the server and continues its work. The response from the server is handled once it arrives.
 **Stub Generation:**    
- Stubs are generated by RPC frameworks to handle the communication details. The client-side stub is responsible for serializing the request and sending it to the server, and the server-side stub is responsible for deserializing the request, calling the actual procedure, and then serializing and sending back the response.
**Error Handling:**    
- Error handling is crucial in RPC as it involves network communication which is prone to failures. The RPC framework usually provides mechanisms to handle errors such as timeouts, unreachable server, etc.
**Parameter Passing:**    
- Parameters can be passed by value or by reference in RPC. Passing by value involves sending a copy of the actual parameter, while passing by reference involves sending a reference to the actual parameter.
**Security:**
- Security is a significant concern in RPC, especially when it is used over the internet. Authentication, authorization, encryption, and integrity checks are essential to secure RPC communications.
**Use Cases:**
- RPC is widely used in distributed computing environments, cloud services, microservices architectures, and various network-based services and applications.

### Conclusion:
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in concurrent programming is a powerful mechanism that allows programs to execute code and communicate across different machines, abstracting the complexities of network communication, and enabling the development of distributed systems. It is crucial to handle synchronization, error handling, security, and other aspects properly to leverage the benefits of RPC effectively.
