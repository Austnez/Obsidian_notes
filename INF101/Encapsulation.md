In Java, encapsulation is the mechanism that binds together code and data that is being manipulated. Encapsulation protects the data and the code from outside interference. We can comparing it to a wrapper that controls access to the encapsulated elements through a defined interface. The concept is illustrated by an automatic transmission in a car, where the gear-shift lever serves as the interface.

Encapsulation allows different implementations while providing a consistent way to access and use the encapsulated code without unexpected side effects. In Java, encapsulation is achieved through classes, which define the structure and behavior of [[Objects and Methods]]. [[Classes]] consist of member variables (data) and methods (code). The public interface of a class is accessible to external users, while private members are restricted to the class itself. This ensures proper usage and prevents unauthorized access to internal details.

important notes about encapsulation:
- Encapsulation binds code and data together and protects them from outside interference.
- It is like a protective wrapper with a well-defined interface.
- The example of an automatic transmission illustrates encapsulation in the real world.
- Encapsulation allows different implementations while providing a consistent user experience.
- In Java, encapsulation is achieved through classes, which contain member variables and methods.
- Member methods define how member variables can be used, defining the behavior and interface of a class.
- Public interface is accessible to external users, while private methods and variables are restricted to the class.
- The public interface should be carefully designed to avoid exposing too much of the class's inner workings.
